# DiscordBotPublic
This is a public facing repo of my discord bot to show progress I've made in learning about making a discord bot and using javascript. My actual repo is private due to privacy concerns for some of the files but at the time of writing this (8/26/22), it is relatively up to date.

There are missing files that contain sensitive info but the main file is there and example json files I use
